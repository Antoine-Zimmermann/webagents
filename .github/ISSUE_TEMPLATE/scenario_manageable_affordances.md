## Title: Pick a descriptive title for your scenario

### Submitter(s): 

Put your name here.

### Motivation:

Provide a description of the problem that is solved by the scenario and a reason why this scenario is important for the users.

### Expected Participating Entities:

List the entities participating to the scenario, such as IoT devices, Web services, data services, origin clients (e.g. browsers, software agents, other service consumers).

### Workflow:

Provide a detailed description of the workflow for this use case, i.e. who interacts with what and in which order and timeline.

### Related Use Cases (if any):

Describe possible use case variants (if applicable).

### Existing solutions:

Provide links to relevant solutions to be considered if you know any.

### Identified Requirements by the TF:

This can be filled out after submission, but if you know already, you can fill it.

1. target entity(ies) of the motivating scenario, i.e. what is the scenario about (action execution, event handling, physical process execution, etc.); the target typically represents a long-lived entity
2. life cycle of the target entity(ies), e.g. states and transitions for an action execution, event handling, physical process execution, etc.; a target entity would typically prescribe affordances for managing its life cycle
3. information conveyed about affordances (e.g., possible outcomes, contextual information) or related affordances, if any (e.g., links to affordances for managing the life cycle of a target entity)
4. how the life cycle is influenced (via affordances)
5. communication protocols: This is how step 4 is executed in real life
6. representation formats: This is the serialization of the information conveyed, i.e. step 3
7. security and privacy considerations
8. other

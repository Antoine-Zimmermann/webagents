## Meeting Notes

### Welcome & Motivation
[Slides](WebAgentsCG-Welcome.pdf) [Andrei Ciortea, Alessandro Ricci, Antoine Zimmermann]

Drawing a motivation:
- Starting from Sir Tim Berners-Lee's ('94): "Semantics allow machines to manipulate and browse through reality"
- W3C Web of Things now enables API documentation for Machines: Given a single URI, the Consumer can achieve their design objectives just by navigating the hypermedia environment and deciding among 

Some motivating questions:
- How to design hypermedia-based environments that support autonomous behavior?
- How to design software agents able to learn, plan, and adapt in order to achieve their tasks through flexible autonomous use of hypermedia?
- How to design, represent, and reason about interactions among autonomous agents, people, and other resources on the Web?
- How to design and govern communities of autonomous agents and people on the Web?

This list is not a proposal of questions to be investigated. They are only meant to motivate why we need a broader perspective that requires insight from multiple communities, which we idenitfy broadly as:
- Web Architecture and the Web of Things
- Semantic Web and Linked Data
- Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

Other initiatives/events that brought together these communities:
- [The First Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems (HyperAgents 2019)](http://www2019.hyperagents.org/), co-located with TheWebConf 2019
- [Dagstuhl Seminar 21072 on Autonomous Agents on the Web (Feb. 2021)](https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072)
- [Dagstuhl Seminar 23081 on Agents on the Web (Feb. 2023)](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23081)

The WebAgents CG was an initiative that started at the last Dagstuhl Seminar.

We have a [first draft of the CG's charter](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/blob/cg-charter-draft/charters/webagents-cg-2023-draft.html), which includes among others:
- the goals of the CG
- what is the scope of the work
- what is out of scope

The draft charter is available for feedback until July 31 (see [PR #1](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/pull/1))

The WebAgents CG will be present at the TPAC, see the [proposed agenda and organizational details](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/tree/main/Meetings/2023-09-11-TPAC). Early bird registration for TPAC available until July 15.


### Personal introductions

**Antoine:** Should we all put a few words about ourselves here?

**Danai:** Antoine, could you please give it a start?!

**Andrei:** I am an assistant professor at the University of St.Gallen, Switzerland, and an external collaborator of the WIMMICS team at INRIA Sophia Antipolis, France. My main research interest is in Web-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), my main areas of expertise are the Web Architecture and enginering MAS.

**Alessandro:** Associate professor at the University of Bolgona, Italy.

**Antoine:** I work at Mines Saint-Étienne, France (near Lyon) and have been doing research in the Semantic Web for 19 years (in relation to knowledge representation, data management and processing, foundations of SemWeb tech, and more) and got interested in agents technologies when I started working with Andrei 10 years ago. I am one of the co-chair of the Autonomous Agents on the Web community group. My overly long and colourful online CV is at [https://w3id.org/people/az/cv](https://w3id.org/people/az/cv)

**Danai:** I am a PhD student at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. My research interests concern declarative interaction specifications for artificial and human agents on the Web. 

**Daniel:** PhD Student at FAU in Nuremberg, Germany, working on Multi-Agent Systems in the Semantic Web. Especially interested in the commonalities of Stigmergy and RESTful architectures as well as how affordances of server can be described such that agents can reason about them. 

**Nicoletta:** 

**Jan:** Master student at the University of St.Gallen, Switzerland.

**Simon:** I am a “Ubiquitous Computing” person and I like building systems. I am hence interested in more ubiquitous computing environment, world-wide. In this context, for me this CG ideally complements the Web of Things group.

**Jean-Paul:**

**Fabien Gandon** http://fabien.info Senior Researcher at Inria and W3C AC Rep for Inria with a background in knowledge representation with graphs, RDF, Linked Data, ontologies and AI in general with a PhD in distributed Multiagent systems applied to distributed RDF

**Katharine:** PhD student at University College Dublin studying hypermedia MAS and applying learning mechanisms in such systems. Before starting the PhD I was a software engineer in industry for a number of years.

**Julian:** (https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/julian-padget) at the University of Bath in the UK. I have three lines of research that intersect with this group: knowledge representation and reasoning, agent architecture and software engineering. Under KRR I have been working on norms and policies (described using a domain-specific action language called InstAL; it’s a bit like the event-calculus) to guide agent decision-making, potentially through the provision of reasoning services. In terms of agent architecture, earlier work extended BDI reasoning to incorporate norm-related percepts, but my hope here is that we can create a modular, composable and reconfigurable architecture for agents. Under SE, my interest is in how to create socio-technical systems that capture, embed, monitor and (dynamically) align with (human) stakeholder values.

**Jérémy:** I am Jérémy Lemée, PhD student at the University of St. Gallen in the Interactions group (https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-interactions-mayer/). Based on my Master thesis on bringing signifiers to agents, I became interested in ways (based or not on signifiers) by which agents, with heterogeneous architectures, knowledge and abilities, can share their knowledge and abilities. I consider the Web as a means to make this collaboration happen at a global scale. 
I also have some experience on bringing agents to the Web of Things due to my participation in the IntellIoT project ( https://intelliot.eu/ ), whose purpose is to create autonomous and intelligent IoT systems.

**Yousouf:** I am Yousouf Taghzouti, a 3rd year PhD student at École des Mines in Saint-Étienne, France. I do research in the Semantic Web, with a particular interest in the problem of semantic content negotiation. I am supervised by Professors @Antoine Zimmermann and @Maxime Lefrançois.  The interest of this group is related to the problem I am investigating on profile content negotiation. Last year I had a mobility at the University of St. Gallen in the team of Professor @Simon, together with Professor @Andrei, @Danai and @Jeremy, where we worked on a scenario of a web-based multi-agent system to provide adequate content to software agents according to their abilities.

**Jomi:**

**Dave:** I am a web old timer and AI researcher at ERCIM, working on swarm intelligence and human-like AI, concerned about security, trust, scalability, resilience, swarms, programmability (e.g. low-code frameworks), and adaptability (e.g. machine learning). I am also intrigued by the miraculous advances in AI based upon deep learning. Is traditional knowledge engineering now obsolete? The concept of hypermedia and hypermedia fabric need a much better explanation.  The charter further lacks information on use cases and business needs, or in other words, what is the problem you want to solve and why do you think it is important?  What is the market for such agents and who will be the users? We need to address communication and marketing to people outside of the group!

**Ege:** I am a researcher at Siemens in Munich. I am one of the editors of the Thing Description specification at the W3C WoT and also one of the co-chairs of the WoT Community Group. I am interested in finding solutions to include proactive Things in the Web of Things, where the current status-quo considers Things to not have their own intentions.

## Upcoming Actions

The WebAgents CG @ TPAC 2023: Sept 11th, 2023
- Submission deadline for position statements: July 31
- Link to agenda and organizational details: https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/tree/main/Meetings/2023-09-11-TPAC
- Joint Meeting with the WoT CG/WG : https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Main_WoT_WebConf/2023_WoT_TPAC_Agenda 

**Antoine:** frequency of online meetings? I think that after the TPAC meeting, we could meet once a month. We could change the time of the meeting, alternating between Euro-friendly and America-friendly with Asia/Oceania joining the one that is best for them

## Open Discussion: Objectives and Expected Outcome of the WebAgents CG

WebAgents CG Wiki: https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/wiki for building more consensus, discuss use cases, set objectives

**Dave (paraphrasing):** More examples are needed to communicate and present the CG to others. 
- Who would be interested in the work of this CG?
- Who would be the users of the applications? 
- What is expected by the CG (e.g. applications that reach production)? 
- What are the use cases? 
- Marketing/commercial aspects

**Antoine (paraphrasing):** The Charter can be used to identify such ideas, but discussion is needed

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Podcasts could be used also as a communication strategy to disseminate ideas and knowledge

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** Many of the current questions in this CG have been pending for years. Expertise exists but it is spread across communities (e.g. Semantic Web, Web etc.). This CG should be used to create these links among the communities that hold part of the expertise.

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Any open issues in the Web of Things CG, to which this CG could be relevant?

**Ege (paraphrasing):** Open issue in the Web of Things CG: Sensors or actuators are only very reactive, but there is no current solution for entities that do something of their own. 

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Are there any documented use cases?

**Ege (paraphrasing):** It would be interesting to describe the behavior of clients and not just server. E.g. in any case where a device (e.g. a car) sends data by itself to the cloud. Such devices would remain out of the WoT since they are interacting without being asked, but with their own initiative.  

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Consumer descriptions could bear some relation to “agent profiles”.

**Fabien (paraphrasing):** As AR suggested, this group should be here to reach other communities. An alignment of vocabulary (in paper) could be one of the CG’s goals, as well as documenting what are the existing resources (software, papers, directories etc.)

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Already surfing existing demos to be discussed for identifying the linking pins. 

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** Discussing how EMAS is related to Generative AI could be a direction for the CG. What does it mean if Generative agents live in hypermedia environments.

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** The view on what are agents on the Web should be kept broad. 

**Jean-Paul (paraphrasing):** Diverse interests in the CG in the beginning is expected. We should work on defining use cases for setting a clearer scope.

## NEXT ACTION ITEMS 
1. Submit feedback on the CG’s Carter draft (deadline to be set): https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/blob/cg-charter-draft/charters/webagents-cg-2023-draft.html  [All]
2. Call for position statements for TPAC (due July 31st) [All]
3. Define a joint meeting agenda with the WoT CG/WG for the TPAC [Andrei, Ege, Alessandro, Antoine], create a roadmap for the joint meeting and its discussion points (e.g. consumer descriptions)
4. Set 2 meetings for discussing the CG’s objectives for the TPAC (a poll will be circulated by Andrei, probably for the end of August, early September). Set a demo session for identifying ideas for some best/common practices in the community [Andrei]
5. Fill in Wiki pages for curating a list of required reading 
6. Curate a Wiki page for use cases [AZ]

**Antoine:** Ideas of possible things emerging from this group:
1. Report on the landscape of Web Agents: state of the art in research, tools, applications, projects, use cases
2. A joint project or several projects (how to do this across continents?)
3. Joint publications, including a book
4. Educational content (courses, MOOCs, textbook, tutorial)
5. A reference implementation (a library and framework for implementing Web-based MAS) or a more abstract specification of how this should be done – towards standardising

## Joint Agenda with the WoT CG/WG
- A recording of a tutorial on MAS will become available before the TPAC [JH]
- 30min intro, 1h open discussion
- Main WoT WebConf/2023 WoT TPAC Agenda: https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Main_WoT_WebConf/2023_WoT_TPAC_Agenda 
- WoT Use Cases and Requirements: https://w3c.github.io/wot-usecases/ 
- Possible discussion points:
  - What is the narrow waist in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (may relate to interaction protocol specifications, organization specifications, message formats, agent communication languages) ? 

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** FIPA-ACL (http://fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html
) could be a starting point, but it assumes mental states, and pragmatics (not semantics) of messages. It would be complementary to social agency (cc Munindar Singh)

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** Considering the timeline of FIPA-ACL: 1) Existing work was at juxtaposition with the Web Architecture, 2) there were fewer use cases for Web-based MAS. 

**Ege (paraphrasing):** not everything needs to be standardised. The CG should document the interest, and see what W3C members are interested. 

  - How to describe consumers in consumer descriptions?

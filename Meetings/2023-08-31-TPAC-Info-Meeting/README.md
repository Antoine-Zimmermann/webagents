Joint Meeting with the Solid CG: 26th September (14:00 UTC / 16:00 CET)

### Overarching Objectives for the TPAC

After the TPAC, we should create 2-3 Task Forces for working on specific challenges based on use case / scenarios. Suggested challenges for the joint meeting with the WoT CG/Wg (see also the [WoT WG TPAC agenda](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Main_WoT_WebConf/2023_WoT_TPAC_Agenda#Autonomous_Agents_on_the_Web_CG_.28aka_Web_Agents.29)):
- having more proactive consumers: Go beyond “consumers”, i.e. the components that are reactive and interact based on W3C WoT Thing Descriptions. What should be the relevant metadata that should be included in profiles so that we transition from consumers (and consumer profiles) to more autonomous entities (and agent profiles), and enable interactions between such autonomous entities and resources in the environment or other autonomous entities? 
- manageable actions and how to program consumers that can cope with long-running actions. 
- having more collaborative consumers: How to enable consumers to interact with each other, discuss, and create content that other entities (e.g. other consumers) can access and use.

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** In the TPAC, for the above points, there is the need to discuss what will be in the scope of the WoT WG and what will be in the scope of the Web Agent WG for both work and standardisation, and what could be the linking pins between the works of the two groups.

**Arthur (paraphrasing):** What are the similarities between consumer descriptions and action descriptions (e.g. W3C WoT Thing Descriptions)?

**Rem (paraphrasing):** For example, an action may be executed based on information that it is specified in a consumer description.

**Danai:** We can also consider that consumer descriptions may contain information about consumer’s goals, or that thing descriptions contain information about the context in which actions are possible (e.g. in terms of preconditions, and even postconditions). 

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** We should currently plan how to organise the discussion in order to discuss content.

**Julian (writing for himself):** community storage (proposed challenge/task force topic?). I have a couple of student-built PoCs with the aim of providing storage for WoTs where rather than going into the corporate cloud, the storage and the data in it remains under the control of the community that creates it. One solution is built on SOLID, the other is built on Hyperledger and IPFS. It could be useful to understand the requirements for persistent storage and how to realize it for long-running web-agent applications.

**Rem (paraphrasing):** The meeting should be the space for actively listening to the issues of the WoT WG.

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** I suggest asking the presenters to distil a few words from their positions into a post-it.

**Andrei (paraphrasing):** +1 for Alessandro’s suggestion

**Rem (paraphrasing):** +1 for Alessandro’s suggestion

**Antoine (paraphrasing):** +1 for Alessandro’s suggestion

**Arthur (paraphrasing):** +1 for Alessandro’s suggestion

### Members' expectations from the TPAC Meeting

**Danai:** Please, feel free to adjust the notes!

**Andrei  (paraphrasing):** Find convergence for 2-3 Task Force groups

**Antoine  (paraphrasing):** Define the Task Forces and find the use cases for Multi-Agent Systems on the Web

**Rem  (paraphrasing):** Acquire an understanding of what are the existing open issues 

**Alessandro (paraphrasing):** Create a concrete example, e.g. based on the suggested cases, in order to understand 

**Samuele (paraphrasing):** Identify the challenges, and see alignments between people who work on similar topics

**Julian (paraphrasing):** Ensure that we do not get heavily constrained with the details of a very specific example or use case. The set of use-cases should aim to be broadly orthogonal. Need to be time and scope limited to ensure each encapsulates one or just a few interesting questions. We should view the use-cases as stepping-stones to help us understand and develop what should be the principles of agents on the Web.

**Arthur (paraphrasing):** Seek convergence, and understand what are the expected outcomes.

**Jérémy (paraphrasing):** Share ideas and find what are the common threads between people to achieve collaboration

**Pierre-Antoine (paraphrasing):** Identify other people and groups that we could reach out to and receive input from.

**Alexandru (paraphrasing):** See what are the possible alignments, and define Task Forces to create more than one use cases to get behind.

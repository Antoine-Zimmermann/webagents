# WebAgents TPAC Agenda and Organizational Details

TPAC 2023 will be organized on September 11-15 as a hybrid event (Seville, Spain and online). Please 
refer to the [TPAC website](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/) for further details. 

## Draft Agenda

The WebAgents CG received two slots in the TPAC 2023 agenda in the morning of the first day (Monday, 
September 11) â€” all times are CEST (Seville local time):
- 09:30-11:00: we will use this first slot to organize a face-to-face (f2f) kick-off meeting for our CG;
- 11:30-13:00: we are currently discussing with the WoT CG/WG the possibility of organizing a joint 
meeting (to be confirmed).

The main objective of this f2f kick-off meeting is that, together, we build an overview of the 
WebAgents CG and the joint interests of its members. Therefore, we would like to hear from you and 
organize the content in a bottom-up fashion based on position statements:
- you are invited to submit a position statement of 1-2 pages by ~~**July 31**~~ **August 14** (see 
[Call for Position Statements](#call-for-position-statements) below);
- all CG members will be invited to check out the position statements before the TPAC;
- a selection of position statements will be invited for 5-min presentations at the TPAC.

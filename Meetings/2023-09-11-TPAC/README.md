## Agenda (September 11)

The WebAgents CG received two slots in the TPAC 2023 agenda in the morning of the first day (Monday, 
September 11) â€” all times are CEST (Seville local time):

### [09:30-11:00] F2F Kick-off Meeting

The main objective of the f2f kick-off meeting is that, together, we build an overview of the 
WebAgents CG and the joint interests of its members. Therefore, we would like to hear from you and 
organize the content in a bottom-up fashion based on position statements:
- you are invited to submit a position statement of 1-2 pages by ~~**July 31**~~ **August 31** (see 
[Call for Position Statements](#call-for-position-statements) below);
- all CG members will be invited to check out the position statements before the TPAC;
- a selection of position statements will be invited for 5-min presentations at the TPAC.

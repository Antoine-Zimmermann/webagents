# Autonomous Web Agents as Knowledge Graphs prosumers

An in-person meeting will take place on the 29th of August, 2024 in Dublin, at the same location as the EUMAS conference.
This event is organised as part of the activities of the COST Action CA19134 on [Distributed Knowledge Graphs](https://cost-dkg.eu/).

## Summary

Software agents that must interact with an open set of web resources must have machine-processable descriptions of said resources. Moreover, if they want to collaborate between them or with people online, they need to provide knowledge about themselves or about what they want, do, what they are capable of, etc. Therefore, autonomous agents should be providers and consumers of knowledge graphs distributed on the Web. This workshop should aim at discussing the design of KGs that describe actionable web resources, as well as agents, their communication interfaces, and possibly multi agent societies with their norms and rules. The workshop will also include demonstrations of implemented systems of Web agents.

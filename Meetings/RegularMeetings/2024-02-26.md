## Meeting Notes

Related to Manageable affordances TF: Ege has 3 scenarios to present. 

Presentation of requirements for Manageable Affordances posted as issue -> [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/34](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/34)



**Introduction of new members:**

    Nesrine Hafiene: post-doc at Mines Saint-Ãˆtienne, working in the HyperAgents project



**Presentation of UseCases** by Ege



- Local Device Discovery ([https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/29)](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/29))

   * Inspired by how the WoT Gateway works to discover devices.  Actions invoked on the gateway.
   * This is a lengthy process as you may need to wait for devices to advertise themselves. 
   * The invoker is interested in when the required device is found, but the discovery process may end later or even may never end... (e.g. but you notice only if the device is never found)
   * There is an implementation by Siemens of this behaviour that we can look into for additional details.
   * 

- Safety Checks in Industrial Motor Drivers ([https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/30)](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/30))

   * Industrial Motor Drivers have the logic to control the motor (e.g. state machine) and can perform checks.
   * The control for the motor may be deferred on the actual starting and stopping of the motor itself, usually now there is no difference for the Consumer to know that this action is successfull and exactly when it is successfull.
   * A more knowleadgeable consumer may want to know how to move across different states in the logic controllers to peform a specific operation.


- Blind and Light Actions in SmartHome ([https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/31)](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/31))

   * Some actions last longer than HTTP timeout (e.g. closing a blind or long transition of lights)
   * You may want to stop a running action in the middle of it (because you reached the desired state)
   * There is some work coming from the webthings.io project
   * 

   * Antoine: multiple-agents (or humans) can negotiate how to change the light level and interact
   * 

   * If multiple consumers need to be able to start and stop the same action the representation needs to be "visible" to all.
   * 

   * Iwona: preferences of users can move the device in a "state" that will limit the possibilities of what can be done. 


   * Manageable actions must be visible to multiple agents (most of the time). The usual "request-response" does not work in this case.
   * Different patterns may depend on the privacy requirements of the affordance.
   * 

A possible new proposal may be about the management of experiments with electronic microscopes, some people have presented this in the WoT CG and they had to extend the standard to model experiments lasting a full week (maybe we can invite them)



**Moving forward with Manageable Affordances Use Cases**

We collected already several use cases, it could be interesting to start detailing them a bit more with additional requirements.



Requirements are listed here: [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/34](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/34)



Who submitted a scenario could try to add on these in order to improve the details of the Scenario



**Use Case Task Force Report **

At the moment only two use cases by email, they need to be reviewed.

Template for Generic Use case is available in the "create new issue" menu.



**Task Forces launch**

- Social-Technical Network 

- Policies and Regulation



Remember to use this form to submit proposals for meetings (anything ranging from topics, new TaskForces etc)

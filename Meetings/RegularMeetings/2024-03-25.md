### Report draft

Target: July 

### Requirements derived from use cases

<ins>Goal</ins>: to create a CG report, starting with the scenarios submissions and their requirements along with any gaps in existing standards, and mechanism proposals. The process for the above should take place asynchroniously. 

<ins>Next Steps</ins>: The next step is to gather the requirements of each scenario. Each scenario contibutor should *edit* their scenario description based on the instruction available in the Requirements template.

<ins>Example Requirements for the "Manageable Actions in ML Pipelines" scenario</ins>

*See here for the full details of the example*: [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/24](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/24)
   1. target entity of the motivating scenario: an ML pipeline;  (Julian: In what levels of granularity should the pipeline activities be considered? Ege: Details can be provided in extent during step (2) life cycle)
   1. Life cycle: 
       1. Pipeline is requested
       1. Waiting for resources to be allocated
       1. Pipeline is provisioned (resources are allocated)
       1. Running the pipeline
       1. (Optional) Pause the pipeline
       1. (If no failure) Retrieval of results
       1. Finished: Archived (storing for provenance and audit), deleted
   1. Information conveyed about affordances: Current Step, Completed Steps, Next Steps (could be more or less known in advance but dynamic decision making is possible. To be further detailed since that will give a reason for applying Web agents), Results of Steps, Resource Consumption (live), Performance/Quality of Steps 
   1. How the life cycle is influenced: Tool-specific interfaces to switch states. In the beginning, the input data needs to be provided. (More details need to be provided)
   1. Communication protocols: Bespoke REST APIs or wrapped into an SDK
   1. Representation formats: Various. JSON in case of REST API
   1. Security and privacy considerations: Shared reources are used and IP-relevant data of companies are used. Each user gets an account and their space, this nothing is shared between useds. An agent needs to act on "their" own pipelines only. 

Possible Gaps:
   * The way to influence and represent the pipelines is tool-specific and not standardized.

## Use Cases Task Force (UC TF)

Rem: There's a lot of use cases in the MA TF, that could be applied in the UC TF.

Antoine: It would be good that anyone who has a scenario for the MA TF, could think how the scenario could be generalized to be applicable for the UC TF. 

Rem:  Contributors of scenarios for the MA TF, could create a (initially, simple) description of a use case that relates to the scenario. Currently, there is one use case proposed for the UC TF: [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/36](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/36) 

Andrei: There could be a report prepared for the upcoming TPAC. Additionally, having prepared some prototypes until the TPAC would be very exciting. 

Antoine: It should be discussed how the proposed use cases can be *evaluated* through a set of criteria so that they are accepted for the UC TF. 

Rem: Proposed use cases could be discussed through emails, for example, by providing feedback, and comments about whether something is missing from the current proposed use case: [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/36](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/36) 

Julian: A use case could be derived from a recent publication about vaccination processes (first author: Timotheus Kampik). Link to paper: [https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3507910](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3507910)

## COST Action on Distributed Knowledge Graph

Antoine: There is a COST action on Distributed Knowledge Graphs (DKG). There is a proposal for a workshop where part of the costs can be partially covered by the COST action. An email will be sent for providing more details and evaluating the current interest for attendance. It would be a chance to create bridges between the DKG work and WebAgents

## Meeting notes

There is no new participant.

### Use Case Task Force Updates:

   * Suggestion to use one or several regular meetings to discuss domains of interest for use cases (as listed during the [regular meeting of 17 June](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/blob/main/Meetings/RegularMeetings/2024-06-17.md#open-discussion))
   * So far many members seem to be interested on the **healthcare domain**. An email will be sent to inform members that the healthcare domain will be probably the first domain to be used for drawing a use case.

### Manageable Affordances Task Force Updates:

   * Some of the past scenario submissions have been extended to include Scenario Requirements (see the "Context-Based Authorized Access to Thing Affordances" scenario at [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/40)](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/issues/40))
   * No new scenario submissions

### Further updates (Distributed Knowledge Graphs and Web Agents Workshop@EUMAS 2024): 

   * A simple scenario was given to the participants of the working session: "An autonomous vacuum cleaner that has the goal to clean a house, without disturbing the occupants of the house. The vacuum cleaner should adapt to the occupants' schedule to decide when to clean." 
   * Relevant questions tackled by participants of the working session:
       * What type of knowledge needs to be accessible in a KG to enable the vacuum cleaner agent to decide when to clean? 
       * How to manage the knowledge in a distributed setup? 
       * What agents need to be part of the MAS? 
       * What should happen when a new agent joins the environment?
   * Antoine: Regarding the event of an agent joining the distributed environment, I think that the agent would benefit from interacting with existing agents (or services) that have a precise dedicated role (such as a "do not disturb agent" assigned to each occupant) rather than having a detailed description of the environement and people and figure out everything by itself

### Multi-Agent Micro-Services demo and presentation (Rem)

The [slides presented by Rem](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/blob/main/Meetings/RegularMeetings/2024-09-19-MAMS-Rem.pdf) are available in the [Regular meeting folder](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/tree/main/Meetings/RegularMeetings).

Antoine: How is the schema of the JSON representations used in the HTTP calls?

Rem: we use HAL - Hypertext Application Language ([https://stateless.group/hal\_specification.html)](https://stateless.group/hal\_specification.html)) see also [https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/](https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/)

Danai: How much does the demo implementation reflects the 3-layer architecture presented in the last slide?

Rem: The demo predates the 3-layer architecture and uses HAL rather than Linked Data. In practice the agents in the layered architecture are implemented as AOMS which are part of the microservices layer. Further, the resources exposed as part of their hypermedia bodies also may contribute to the Distributed Knowledge Graph in the same way that the other services contribute. The example I have consists of 3 services: an auction service, a set of buyer services (implemented as an AOMS for demo purposes) and a seller service (also implremented as an AOMS for demo purposes). The emergent HAL linked data structure (it is not a knowledge graph because it is not based on RDF) forms the equivalent of a knowledge graph connecting resources across these three services.  

Danai: would you consider a setup where there are different services for the sellers, for the buyers, etc?

Rem: they could run separately, this is distributed, but we run it on one VM.

Alexandru: in the KG layer that you suggest, what parts should be described and what should be internalised in the MAS?

Rem: we have different cases, some where everything is exposed via HTTP, others uising Fipa internally
In the auction UC, we have an entrypoint from which we can navigate different parts

Alex: do you have a strategy to decide these things?

Rem: more practice is needed to answer this.

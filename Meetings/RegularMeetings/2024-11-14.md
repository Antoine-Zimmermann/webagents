## Meeting Notes

**Note from scribes**: unfrotunately, we were unable to keep meeting notes during the meeting as we were also building the discussion. What follows is a short summary written after the meeting.

Andrei: Reviewed meeting notes from Oct. 28. We had a special session in preparation of WoT Week 2024. We'll have a hybrid CG meeting on Nov. 26 from 4pm CET.

Ege: There is new work from Deutsche Telekom on a platform for building and running MAS named LMOS: [https://lmos-ai.org/](https://lmos-ai.org/). The platform will focus on using the WoT standards. The creators might be present at WoT Week 2024.

Andrei: I would like to propose a new task force (TF), a Web-based MAS TF or Interoperability TF. We already have multiple implementations of Web-based MAS in the CG, it would be great to bring them to the same table. This TF would also have a broader scope than, e.g., the Manageable Affordances TF and might encourage broader participation from the CG.

Andrei: To keep this discussion as concrete as possible, I want to show you a demonstrator for a hypermedia extension I've implemented for JADE after the first Dagstuhl Seminar on Agents on the Web (Feb. 2021). JADE is, in my mind, the posterchild implementation of the FIPA standards from the early 2000s. The FIPA standards were already covering many things, they were just missing hypermedia.

Andrei shows demonstrator. The implementation is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/interactions-hsg/jade-hypermedia](https://github.com/interactions-hsg/jade-hypermedia)

Jean-Paul: One of the things we tried to do a couple of years ago is to bring the FIPA standards in the modern Linked Data view. We had a paper on this topic at EUMAS 2018.

There is consensus that there is a need for launching this new TF.

We also discussed about organizing a meeting on the topic that emerged from the discussion: evolution, self-organization, and cognitive stigmergy.

Topics for future meetings:
- LMOS: [https://lmos-ai.org/](https://lmos-ai.org/)
- Evolution, self-organization, and cognitive stigmergy

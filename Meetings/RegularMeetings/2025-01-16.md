## Meeting Notes

[AC] Introduction of new members

[GC] Presented himself "Here is my open source project: [https://github.com/chgaowei/AgentNetworkProtocol](https://github.com/chgaowei/AgentNetworkProtocol), and agent communication protocol."

[AC]  Agenda presented \& highlights poll for new timeslots

       * [https://evento.renater.fr/survey/webagents-cg-regular-meetings-2025-4oua6eau](https://evento.renater.fr/survey/webagents-cg-regular-meetings-2025-4oua6eau)
[AC] REview of minutes from last meeting

[AC] Good discussion around evolution, cognitive stigmery, ...

[AC] Submitted a proposal for HyperAgents @ ECAI 2025

[AC] Supplement workshop with F2F meeting \& possibly PlugFest

[AC] Introduces the main topic: Interoperabilty TF (proposed TF description at [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/tree/tf-interoperability/TaskForces/Interoperability)](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/tree/tf-interoperability/TaskForces/Interoperability))

[AC] History FIPA Standards \& reference platform: AgentCities

[AC] Asked about experiences

[RC] Good demonstration of interoperatbility but lack of use cases / practical deployments

[JP] Described one deployment around Tourism \& mentioned he has slides on other initiatives

[AC] Moved on to discuss DARPA DAML Project and impact on Semantic.Web

[AC] Overview of main topics (as per TF description)

[AZ] Some use cases from Linked Web Storage Working Group are relevant to WebAgents CG

       * [https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues](https://github.com/w3c/lws-ucs/issues)
       * Also, there is an ongoing discussion on Agentic Linked Data on the Solid CG: [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid/2025Jan/0001.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid/2025Jan/0001.html)
[AC] Number of possible existing standards could be used.

[AC] Discussing some of the standards

[AC] Plan is for monthly meetings + async interactions

[RC] We had meetings to discuss UCs in specific topics (e.g. healthcare)

[AO] Questioned the existence of Use cases

[AC] We have a TF for that

[AO] Interested to demo FlashMAS

[RC] The Use Cases TF needs more support to drive the development of use cases

[AC] Talked about the lack of engagement, our original plan to get members to submit full Use Case descriptions and the switch to focus groups



[AC] gives first example: Yggdrasil

[AC] Mentions a second demo that demonstrates agent profiles

[AO] Where do we see the Thing artifact being used?

[AC] Shows the creation of Thing artifact \& highlights a number of libraries that they have used to deliver the funvtionality.

[AO] how do you discover actions / how do you invoke actions

[AC] the invokeAction(...) CArtAgO operation.

[RC] perhaps start to move to wrapup

[AC] summarising demo

[RC] start to put some of these libraries on our resources section.

[AC] back to Interoperability TF

[AC] Web is not just a transport layer for agent communication, the Web can be come the application layer/environment for MAS

[RC] Who will get involved in the Interoperability TF?

[DC] Will engage

[AO] Will engage

[AZ] Will engage

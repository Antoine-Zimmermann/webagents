# Interoperability

**Moderators:** Andrei Ciortea, Rem Collier

## Description

The vision of a world-wide open network of agents has been around since the late '90s. Prominent initiatives included the [Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)](http://www.fipa.org/) standardization efforts, AgentCities (see [EPFL Technical Report](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/52462)), and the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program. DAML paved the way for several cornerstones of the Semantic Web, such as the [OWL Web Ontology Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and [Semantic Markup for Web Services (OWL-S)](https://www.w3.org/submissions/2004/07/).

The Interoperability Task Force resurfaces this vision to enable interoperability among modern implementations of Web-based agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using the latest Web standards and protocols. The scope of the investigation includes but is not limited to:
- Agent Identifiers: how agents are identified, how their credentials are verified, etc.
- Agent Profiles: how agents describe themselves, their services, relationships, etc.
- Agent Communication: how agents communicate over the Web, what interaction protocols, languages, and message formats they use, etc.

This topic is relevant to some of the activities of the Solid CG (see [notes from the joint meeting on 26.09.2023](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-09-26.md)) and potentially the Linked Web Storage WG.

## Activity

Suggested activities for this task force:
- reviewing the state-of-the-art; topics include:
  - specifications (W3C, [FIPA](http://www.fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html), [Solid](https://solidproject.org/specification), etc.) and ontologies ([hMAS](https://purl.org/hmas/core), etc.) relevant for Web-based MAS
  - platforms, frameworks, and applications of Web-based MAS
- identifying and documenting requirements and gaps
- proposing specifications and guidelines for interoperable Web-based MAS
- developing reference implementations of the proposed specifications and guidelines
- organizing PlugFests for the proposed specifications and guidelines

The TF will meet regularly every month and will also interact async.

## Expected Outcome

An CG group report on interoperable Web-based MAS (initial report).

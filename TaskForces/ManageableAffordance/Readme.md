# Manageable Affordances

**Moderators:** Ege Korkan, Andrei Ciortea

## Description

Action Affordance in the current W3C WoT specifications is rather simplistic, where a Consumer sends a request and the Thing responds. 
It is unclear whether the response corresponds to the result of the physical action process or whether it is just an acknowledgment. 
Thus, it is needed to better describe the lifecycle of an action for Consumers to better interact with the Thing. 
Examples include long-lasting dimming of a light or long-lasting movements such as robots, and cameras (panning, tilting). 
Given that the hypermedia community is also represented in the WebAgents CG, the discussions would benefit from the various expert viewpoints in the CG.

This topic is relevant to the new WoT WG charter and the results of this TF may provide non-normative input to the standardization efforts.

## Activity

Suggested activities for this task force:
- reviewing the state-of-the-art; topics include:
  - the W3C WoT specifications for action affordances
  - affordance theory
  - architectures and programming paradigms for autonomous agents
- identifying and documenting current limitations and gaps
- proposing mechanisms for manageable action affordances

The TF will meet regularly every two weeks and will also interact asynchronously.

## Expected Outcome

A CG group report on manageable affordances.

# Use Case Requirements Template

This file contains the requirements template that should be used in use cases submitted for manageable affordances task force.
Please use these categories and type of information to extend your submission's requirements.

1. target entity(ies) of the motivating scenario, i.e. what is the scenario about (action execution, event handling, physical process execution, etc.); the target typically represents a long-lived entity

2. life cycle of the target entity(ies), e.g. states and transitions for an action execution, event handling, physical process execution, etc.; a target entity would typically prescribe affordances for managing its life cycle

3. information conveyed about affordances (e.g., possible outcomes, contextual information) or related affordances, if any (e.g., links to affordances for managing the life cycle of a target entity)

4. how the life cycle is influenced (via affordances)

5. communication protocols: This is how step 4 is executed in real life

6. representation formats: This is the serialization of the information conveyed, i.e. step 3

7. security and privacy considerations

8. other

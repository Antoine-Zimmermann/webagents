# Use Cases

**Moderators:** Antoine Zimmermann, Rem Collier

## Description

The Use Cases Task Force is investigating how Web Agents could be used in real-world scenarios where an alternative approach would be more costly, more difficult, or less sustainable.
The main task is to provide proper descriptions of individual use cases according to uniform templates and criterias. Each use case should be discussed with respect to its relevance, the technical details of its description, the issues that come from using Web Agents technologies and the issues that come from /not/ using them.

## Activity

Suggested activities for this task force:
- collecting use cases
- agreeing on a template for use cases
- identifying the challenges in use cases and balancing them with the benefits
- analysing and categorising use cases in order to find requirements

The TF will meet regularly every *X* weeks and will also interact asynchronously (TO BE DECIDED).

## Expected Outcome

A CG report containing all use case descriptions, sorted according to the categorisation done by the TF, and a set of requirements that ensue.

Initially, it was expected that the Wiki of the repository would be used to collect use cases (see the UC *[Assistant on discussion boards](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/wiki/Use-cases-for-Autonomous-Web-Agents)*). However, it would be better to have all use cases pulled to this folder, with regular pull requests.
The Web of Thingsinterest group has [a template for WoT use cases](https://github.com/w3c/wot-usecases/blob/main/USE-CASES/use-case-template.md) that could be the basis of our own template.
